			<h1>Volunteer with City Fare</h1>
			<p>Imagine running a restaurant where each weekday between 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., about 750 customers order their lunch - all at the same time.  And they all want their orders delivered to their homes. Now, take it a step further, and imagine that you are short staffed nearly every single day.</p>
			
			<p>That is a typical day at City Fare Meals on Wheels.</p>
			
			<p>We are fortunate to have a dedicated group of volunteers who we schedule to deliver Meals on Wheels each day at lunch time, however; there are gaps in our coverage and we are in need of volunteers to deliver Meals on Wheels throughout New Castle County. We are aggressively reaching out to individuals, church and civic groups and companies to encourage their employees to become involved in the community and in our program.</p>
			
			<div class="callout">We have 40 Meals on Wheels routes to cover each day!</div>
			
			<p>If you are a business owner, we ask you to consider lending us just two employees per week for an hour or so. If you are an employee, ask your boss or human resources officer about pitching in and supporting Meals on Wheels and the homebound individuals we serve.  It is a very rewarding experience. As we like to say – Enjoy a lunch that is good for your heart!</p>
			
			<p>Our Corporate Volunteers include WSFS Bank, Citibank, M&T Bank, Delmarva Power, Astra Zeneca, DuPont, JPMorganChase, Capital One/ING Direct and Agilent Technologies.</p>
			
			<p>Our Small Business Partners include Principal Trust, Prudential Fox Roach, Patterson Schwartz, Remax ,True Value and Boyd’s Flowers.</p>
